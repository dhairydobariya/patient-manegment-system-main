Patient Management System
Figma Link: Patient Management System Design
Project Overview:
The Full Stack Patient Management System includes both a Patient Panel and an Doctor Panel, with various functionalities such as authentication, profile management, appointment scheduling, patient records, prescriptions, teleconsultations, payments, and more. The team will consist of 3 developers: 1 for frontend, 1 for backend, and 1 full-stack developer.
The project timeline is structured over 9 days, with the remaining 3 days dedicated to final adjustments based on the Figma design. The primary goal is to complete the core modules by the 9th day and ensure alignment with the Figma design.
